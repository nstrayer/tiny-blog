## Hi!

This blogs purpose is to be be an outlet for the little tips and tricks I pick up in my career as a software developer. Professionally I primarily work with Typescript, R, and Python in my role as a developer on the Shiny team at Posit. In my personal life I dabble with a variety of languages such as Swift (and SwiftUi), Go, and Rust.

While I primarily blog for my benefit, I hope that the stuff I write may be of some value to you the reader! 

Happy coding!
